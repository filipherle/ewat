# EWAT
# Introduction

Social engineering, in the context of information security, refers to psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.

I created this project in order to make it easier for IT's and security experts to gather information and pentest.

In order to install this program, it is crucial that you are on a __Linux-based__ distro, preferably __Kali-Linux__ or __Linux-Mint__.
